## üöÄ Overview

Protect your network from ARP spoofing attacks with this powerful and easy-to-use Windows tool. ARP spoofing is a serious threat that allows attackers to intercept or manipulate your network traffic by impersonating your default gateway. This tool continuously monitors your network, alerts you instantly on suspicious activity, and helps you mitigate risks effectively.

---

## üéØ Why Choose This Tool?

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Automatically detects changes in your default gateway's MAC address.
- **Instant Alerts:** Audio (beep or text-to-speech) and popup notifications keep you informed.
- **Auto-Restore:** Automatically fixes your ARP table to prevent traffic interception.
- **Attacker IP Identification:** Displays IP addresses linked to suspicious MAC addresses.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Intuitive controls with system tray integration for seamless operation.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Keeps detailed logs for audit and review.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Detects your default gateway IP** automatically.
2. **Monitors the MAC address** associated with the gateway periodically.
3. **Detects any unexpected MAC changes** indicating possible ARP spoofing.
4. **Alerts you immediately** with audio and visual notifications.
5. **Restores the original ARP entry** to maintain network integrity.
6. **Identifies attacker IPs** associated with suspicious MAC addresses.
7. **Displays attacker IPs** for your awareness (blocking is not performed).

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

1. Download the tool files:
   - `arp_spoof_detector_updated.py`
   - `run_arp_detector_admin.bat` (recommended for easy admin launch)

2. Run the tool as Administrator:
   - Double-click `run_arp_detector_admin.bat` and accept the UAC prompt.
   - Or open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
     ```bash
     python arp_spoof_detector_updated.py
     ```

3. Use the GUI:
   - Click **Start Monitoring** to begin detection.
   - Receive alerts on suspicious activity.
   - View attacker IP addresses in popup and console.
   - Minimize to tray to keep running in the background.
